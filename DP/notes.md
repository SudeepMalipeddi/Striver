# Dynamic Programming

## Questions can of the following types

Count distinct ways to do something.

Count number of ways to do something.

Try all possible ways and find the best one.

Find the minimum/maximum cost/path/length.

## Steps to solve a DP problem

1. Define the objective function.

2. Identify the base cases.

3. Write down a recurrence relation for the optimized objective function.

4. Identify the order of computation.

5. Identify the direction of optimization.

6. Decide if you want to implement it iteratively or recursively.

## Types of DP

1. **Memoization (Top Down)**: The process of storing results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

2. **Tabulation (Bottom Up)**: The process of storing the result of a subproblem and using it to solve the bigger problem.

## Problems

1. [Fibonacci](#fibonacci)

2. [Climbing Stairs](#climbing-stairs)



## Tricks

Try to represent the problem in terms of smaller subproblems.

Try to represent the problem in terms of index

Do all possible stuffs on that in order of problem

if the question says to find the minimum/maximum, then try to find the maximum/minimum of the subproblems.

/*
 * You are given an integer array nums .
The factor score of an array is defined as the product of the LCM and GCD of all elements
of that array.
Return the maximum factor score of nums after removing at most one element from it.
Note that both the LCM and GCD of a single number are the number itself, and the factor
score of an empty array is 0.
The term gcd(a,b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b.
The term lcm(a,b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.
